# Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate an object detection model using the COCO dataset. The objectives include:

1. Model Development: Train a deep learning model to detect and classify objects within images.
2. Performance Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance using standard metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP).
3. Analysis of Results: Analyze the detection results to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
4. Visualization: Visualize detections on images to qualitatively assess the model’s accuracy.

# Data Description
The COCO dataset is a large-scale dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, with over 330,000 images and 80 object categories. The dataset is divided into several parts:
## 1 Images:
Source: COCO dataset, available at COCO Dataset.
Description: High-resolution images containing complex scenes with multiple objects.
Sample:
Example Image: Features various objects like people, vehicles, and animals in realistic settings.
## 2 Annotations:
Type: JSON files containing metadata and annotations for the images.
Variables:
image_id: Unique identifier for the image.
bbox: Bounding box coordinates for the object (format: [x, y, width, height]).
category_id: ID corresponding to the object category.
segmentation: (Optional) Segmentation masks for the objects.
iscrowd: Indicator if the object is part of a crowd.
## 3 Categories:
Variables:
id: Category identifier.
name: Name of the category.
## 4 Splits:

Training Set: Used for training the model.
Validation Set: Used for tuning model parameters and evaluating performance during training.
Test Set: Used for the final evaluation of the model's performance.                                                                                                                                                 


# Conclusion
The project successfully developed an object detection model using the COCO dataset, achieving effective detection of objects in various scenes. Key findings include:

## Model Performance:
Accuracy: The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.75 at an IoU threshold of 0.5, indicating a good balance between precision and recall.
Speed: The model inference speed was 20 frames per second (FPS) on a GPU, suitable for real-time applications.
## Strengths:
High Detection Accuracy: The model performed well in detecting common objects such as people, vehicles, and animals.
Robustness: The model showed robustness across various lighting conditions and occlusions.
## Weaknesses:
Misclassification: Some objects, particularly in cluttered scenes, were occasionally misclassified or missed.
Small Object Detection: The model struggled with detecting very small objects due to resolution limitations.
## Visualization and Analysis:
Detections: Visualization of detection results demonstrated that the model effectively localized and classified objects, but also highlighted areas where improvements are needed.
Sample detection showing bounding boxes and category labels.
## Recommendations for Improvement:
Data Augmentation: Increase the diversity of training data through augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
Model Tuning: Experiment with different architectures or hyperparameters to enhance detection accuracy, especially for smaller objects.
Post-Processing: Improve post-processing techniques like non-maximum suppression (NMS) to reduce false positives.
